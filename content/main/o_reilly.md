[O'Reilly Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Media) is a book publisher/learning company known for its distinctive
animal covers. They are known for having books that are recommended even several
years after publishing date.

For example, [Martin Kleppmann :: Designing
Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and
Maintainable Systems]({{< relref "../references/martinkleppmannDesigningDataIntensiveApplications2017.md" >}}) is a book I still see lauded in tech circles.
