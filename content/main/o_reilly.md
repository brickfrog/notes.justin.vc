## Summary {#summary}

[O'Reilly Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Media) is a book publisher/learning company similar to [Packt Publishing]({{< relref "packt.md" >}}) known for its distinctive
animal covers. Quality feels like it's been lapsing recently, but I think it's
more of a industry-wide thing. Still, some of the books under their banner are
still widely recommended. For example, [Martin Kleppmann :: Designing
Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and
Maintainable Systems]({{< relref "../references/martinkleppmannDesigningDataIntensiveApplications2017.md" >}}) is a book I still see praised in tech circles.
