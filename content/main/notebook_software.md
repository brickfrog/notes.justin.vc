## About {#about}

Notebooks are interactive computing environments that combine code execution,
rich text, mathematics, and plots / media.

### <https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html> {#https-www-cs-faculty-dot-stanford-dot-edu-knuth-lp-dot-html}

I always thought of it as literate programming but apparently that's more about
the documentation - "Literate programming is more about documentation; to refer
to Jupyter Notebooks and similars, Fernando Perez introduced the term literate
computing". It probably doesn't matter, though.

## Options {#options}

Just notes as I ponder them. Generally am loathe to list for-profit/closed
source stuff but there's the potential for use in workplace / if I'm stuck using them.

### Jupyter / Lab {#jupyter-lab}

### Mathematica {#mathematica}

### Deepnote {#deepnote}

<https://deepnote.com> - Seems to be an 'AI first' variant. Another no-code
possibility. I'm.. not a fan of this level of simplicity since a lot of the
problems in the analyst space are domain knowledge 'gotchas', will write more on
it if I ever have to use it for work.

### Hex {#hex}

Another for-profit / closed source one. I learned of this before deepnote, I
like the aesthetics, can't comment on usefulness.
