## Index {#index}

[Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is an extremely useful tool for learning. There's not much
that hasn't been said so I'll be using this more as a place to assemble
resources on it. My favorite software to use for spaced repetition is [anki.](https://apps.ankiweb.net) I
pretty much use it for anything I want/have to remember.
