## Summary {#summary}

[Transcranial direct-current stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation) (tDCS) at its simplest is using
electrodes to 'stimulate' the brain. It was popular in the early 2010's. You
don't see as much discussion about it now. My working hypothesis is, like other
treatment options that require time investments, is that time intensiveness can
dissuade people from trying it (akin to telling people to spend 30 minutes at
the gym every day - which arguably has a better general effect - as an aside if
you're reading this and you're considering tDCS and **don't** exercise, maybe try
that first). There's still studies going on, such as using it for
depression.[^fn:1]

## Personal Notes {#personal-notes}

I first started trying it around ~2023 - I use the "montages" (what they call
placement, I don't know why, this confused me at first) related to learning. I
feel like it has an effect but it could be a placebo, of course. The only real
cost (as I'm sitting at my computer anyways) is the most popular consumer
mechanisms for it are battery operated, but you can honestly just buy some
batteries in bulk on Amazon.

### DARPA's "Accelerated Learning" {#darpa-s-accelerated-learning}

-   Specifically, I use the DARPA "accelerated learning"
    montage[^fn:2] for ~30 minutes a day at 2.0mA,
    usually before doing my language studies or tinkering around with new code /
    reading a new codebase.
-   All of the DARPA tDCS studies were meant for acquisition of new skills related
    for military use (of course) - sniping/shooting skills, etc. You can see more
    information about it in the following
    [page](<https://totaltdcs.com/tdcs-montages/accelerated-learning-darpa-montage/>).
    It's pointed out there, but I find it interesting that it got popular enough
    to have podcasts about the topic years later, but then the military
    essentially scrubbed it from its website. I'm not too conspiratorally minded
    so I'm curious if it's either a "this doesn't matter anymore" measure vs. "oh
    no the soldier's brains got damaged".

### Caveats {#caveats}

-   Just more of a covering my bases for anyone who wanders in here, but...
-   The wikipedia article covers most of the concerns but I'd also like to
    reiterate if you wander across this and try it to follow all the instructions.
    -   for example, using salt water and proper electrode placement
    -   electrical burns are difficult to notice when they're happening so if you
        bork things up you might get a small burn without noticing that's enough to
        cause some scarring.
