## Summary {#summary}

[Transcranial direct-current stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation) (tDCS) at its simplest is using
electrodes to 'stimulate' the brain. It was popular in the early 2010's. You
don't see as much discussion about it now. My working hypothesis is, like other
treatment options that require time investments, is that time intensiveness can
dissuade people from trying it (akin to telling people to spend 30 minutes at
the gym every day - which arguably has a better general effect - as an aside if
you're reading this and you're considering tDCS and **don't** exercise, maybe try
that first).

There's also still studies going on, such as using it for
depression.<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">[1]</a> I'd like to read more about it even
though my main use-case is memorization/learning.

## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Personal Notes {#personal-notes}

I first started trying it around ~2023 - I use the "montages" (what they call
placement, I don't know why, this confused me at first) related to learning. I
feel like it has an effect but it could be a placebo, of course. The only
non-time cost is the device itself and that most popular consumer mechanisms for
it are battery operated, but you can honestly just buy some batteries in bulk on
Amazon.

### DARPA's "Accelerated Learning" {#darpa-s-accelerated-learning}

-   Specifically, I use the DARPA "accelerated learning"
    montage for ~30 minutes a day at 2.0mA,
    usually before doing my language studies or tinkering around with new code /
    reading a new codebase.<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">[2]</a>
-   All of the DARPA tDCS studies were meant for acquisition of new skills related
    for military use (of course) - sniping/shooting skills, etc. You can see more
    information about it in the following
    [page](<https://totaltdcs.com/tdcs-montages/accelerated-learning-darpa-montage/>).
    It's pointed out there, but I find it interesting that it got popular enough
    to have podcasts about the topic years later, but then the military
    essentially scrubbed it from its website. I'm not too conspiratorally minded
    so I'm (jokingly) curious if it's either a "this doesn't matter anymore" measure vs. "oh
    no the soldier's brains got damaged".[^fn:1]

### Caveats {#caveats}

-   Just more of a covering my bases for anyone who wanders in here, but...
-   The wikipedia article covers most of the concerns but I'd also like to
    reiterate if you wander across this and try it to follow all the instructions.
    -   for example, using salt water and proper electrode placement
    -   gradual burns are difficult to notice when they're happening so if you
        bork things up you might get a small burn without noticing - there's the
        potential for scarring.[^fn:2]

[^fn:1]: I would also note that I did not in way spend time trying to figure out if they
    simply moved things or not.
[^fn:2]: I did zap myself once after forgetting to reup on salt but that was about
    the worst of it. Basically red skin for an hour or two. Also I'm using this to
    test out footnotes.
