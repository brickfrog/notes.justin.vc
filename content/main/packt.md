## Summary {#summary}

Book Publisher similar to [O'reilly Media]({{< relref "o_reilly.md" >}}). While it has it's gems I'm always a
bit more apprehensive to recommend them for individual books, and it tends to be
a gamble. I don't know what the term for it is, but it `feels` like they're
close to being a vanity publishing house. In that people will basically write a
book just for the resume boost, and Packt helps them accomplish that. I also
think more publishers are drifting that way, though, as it's just the nature of
the business in the age of LLMs.

I would also note that It's been awhile, but their online platform was pretty good the last
time I used it (~2019?). Surprisingly, they outfeatured O'reilly at the time. If I had
some sort of education budget from an employer I'd probably sign up again.
