### I Saw the TV Glow {#i-saw-the-tv-glow}

[I Saw the TV Glow - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_the_TV_Glow) - 2024 film, I wandered into this because of Rotten Tomatoes,
I think. I liked it, the audience score is higher than I thought given
the themes (suburbia, conformity, identity). I could see someone being
disappointed if they came into it purely as a 'horror' fan.

#### Watching Notes {#watching-notes}

-   A24! I feel like I see them everywhere now.
-   Are you afraid of the dark analogue? Campfire scene thingymajig
-   I'm curious if we're going to get more 90's nostalgia like we did with the
    80's
-   Unsure what the pink opaque itself could be a reference to
    -   monster of the week? (was mentioned after - yeah)
    -   musical choice and framing reminds me of twin peaks
-   identity discussion, not feeling anything, asexuality?
    -   (after watching) oh.
-   the time skips aren't as distracting as I was worried about
-   okay, so the uh..  "i need to leave" was literal
-   the overlays feel a bit off, I'm not sure if that was intended?
-   if this was a real show, and I watched it as a kid, I probably would've been traumatized
-   I think I get what it's going for, but uh..
-   I caught a glimpse of the reviews mentioning the trans identity issues - as of
    writing this I didn't expect it to be that object-level? I am curious where it's
    going to go with it
-   soup party
-   so, uh, it was literal, huh
-   okay, working that job is more dread inducing than

### Robot Dreams {#robot-dreams}

[Robot Dreams (film) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Dreams_(film)) - I liked this. Excluding music lyrics, it's
silent. Vibes heavy and full of NYC references. You can see the Guardian
Angels on the subway, and things like that. Came to my surprise that it was a
Spanish director/studio that made this. I don't have any deep thoughts on the
themes but it was wholesome. Some of the meta stuff in the middle felt a bit off
but it didn't detract too much.
