Testing something out. I think I'll use this as a master aggregation list for
film and if I ever want to spin it off into an individual note, I can just
refile it.

### I Saw the TV Glow {#i-saw-the-tv-glow}

[I Saw the TV Glow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_the_TV_Glow) - 2024 film, I wandered into this because of Rotten Tomatoes,
I think. I liked it, the audience score is higher than I thought given
the themes (suburbia, conformity, identity). I could see someone being
disappointed if they came into it purely as a 'horror' fan.

#### Watching Notes {#watching-notes}

-   A24! I feel like I see them everywhere now.
-   Are you afraid of the dark analogue? Campfire scene thingymajig
-   I'm curious if we're going to get more 90's nostalgia like we did with the
    80's
-   Unsure what the pink opaque itself could be a reference to
    -   monster of the week? (was mentioned after - yeah)
    -   musical choice and framing reminds me of twin peaks
-   identity discussion, not feeling anything, asexuality?
    -   (after watching) oh.
-   the time skips aren't as distracting as I was worried about
-   okay, so the uh..  "i need to leave" was literal
-   the overlays feel a bit off, I'm not sure if that was intended?
-   if this was a real show, and I watched it as a kid, I probably would've been traumatized
-   I think I get what it's going for, but uh..
-   I caught a glimpse of the reviews mentioning the trans identity issues - as of
    writing this I didn't expect it to be that object-level? I am curious where it's
    going to go with it
-   soup party
-   so, uh, it was literal, huh
-   okay, working that job is more dread inducing than

### Robot Dreams {#robot-dreams}

[Robot Dreams (film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Dreams_(film)) - I liked this. Excluding music lyrics, it's
silent. Vibes heavy and full of NYC references. You can see the Guardian
Angels on the subway, and things like that. Came to my surprise that it was a
Spanish director/studio that made this. I don't have any deep thoughts on the
themes but it was wholesome. Some of the meta stuff in the middle felt a bit off
but it didn't detract too much.

### Summer Wars <span class="tag"><span class="anime">anime</span></span> {#summer-wars}

[Summer Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Wars) was interesting. Another 'family is important' movie. Due to the
short run time in movie vs. full series you tend to have more trouble getting
attached to larger casts of characters, but I enjoyed the brief moment spent
with most of the family.

I loved the tech vibe though, captured the era quite well (and kind of gave me
sleazy NFT game vibes in the intro) - Of course, a lot of that kind of stuff
wasn't new, you had Habbo hotel and Second Life and such, but still. I'm not
sure how I would've felt about it back then, but a DARPA funded rogue AI not
being able to win at a card game is ???.

Maybe it's just me getting older, but I feel like an entire season of the family
futzing about without AI shenanigans would've been a fun time.

### Mind Games <span class="tag"><span class="anime">anime</span></span> {#mind-games}

[Mind Game (film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_Game_(film)) - This was a trip. I love experimental films, and generally
anything with the overarching theme of not living with regret.

### Penguin Highway <span class="tag"><span class="anime">anime</span></span> {#penguin-highway}

[Penguin Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Highway) - I guess this was originally a novel that got adapted. I'd like
to read it, I'm curious if it's a 1:1 adaptation. I enjoyed the beginning and
end the most, essentially a slice of life just hanging with your friends and
someone  you have a crush on. That'll always be a trope that gets me, of
the mysterious mentor-figure that <span class="spoiler"> eventually has to leave you </span> .
Also, I like the notebooks he keeps. I need to get the new years [HOBONICHI](https://www.1101.com/hoboid/en/). Also
I need to start drawing again.

#### <span class="org-todo todo IDEA">IDEA</span> Notebooks {#notebooks}

An idea would maybe write more stuff in my physical notebooks then translate
them to notes via LLM-based formatting.

### Sword of the Stranger <span class="tag"><span class="anime">anime</span></span> {#sword-of-the-stranger}

[Sword of the Stranger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_the_Stranger) - I liked it, not too much to ponder on - fun sword film
with pretty animation, nice with upscaling. Interesting thing that it was
submitted for an Academy Award and the slots got taken up by Kung-Fu Panda and
Bolt(?). Man, the academy really hated / hates anime, huh.
