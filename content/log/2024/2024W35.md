##### [GitHub - yetone/cosmos-nvim](https://github.com/yetone/cosmos-nvim) {#github-yetone-cosmos-nvim}

Initially tried this, but the lazy.nvim pull broke. Decided to take the part of
it that uses the animated gif in the dashboard, though, because it looks neat.

##### [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org) {#lazyvim}

Ended up using LazyVim, haven't made too many config changes - disabled alpha
and switched to dashboard so I could do the gif.

### Reading {#reading}

#### [X-CMD](https://www.x-cmd.com) {#x-cmd}

I don't think I'd use this, but it's interesting - and a decent aggregate of
tools I might not have heard of.
