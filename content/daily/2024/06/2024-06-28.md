-   Want to see if hyprland + wayland is worth using. Have been using x11 for too
    long and haven't tried to move over ina couple years due to NVIDIA being
    wonky.
    -   I think I mostly got it working. Had to switch display managers.
    -   Ironbar requires some edits.
    -   This basically became a half my day project, but should be good once done.
-   Moved a lot of my theming to catppuccin - pastel vibes.
