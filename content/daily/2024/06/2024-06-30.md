## Notes {#notes}

-   :TIL:  the scripts folder inside mpv, you can use lua scripts that run whenever
    you run mpv.
-   I'd like to add something to emacs/quartz that graphically links all my TILs,
    it'd be a neat thing to comb over.
-   Finished 'the bear' s3 - good, I liked the sole character episodes
-   had an idea of keeping things in mononotes, maybe refactor them if they get
    too big?
