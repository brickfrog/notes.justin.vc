## Notes {#notes}

-   Got sidetracked futzing with arbtt again
-   Thinking maybe better to just toss everything under notes, generally don't
    write enough daily to need disparate sections
-   Starting to do Chinese grammar studying too ontop of character recognition
    -   Saw people recommend SuperChinese - It was between that and Chineasy - I
        basically flipped a coin. They're touting their AI stuff which makes me a
        bit uneasy (considering the propensity that you might bork up your skills)
    -   A yearly sub was pretty cheap, worst case scenario, I'm out ~30 bux
-   Did the GraphRAG thingy from yesterday - I think I could make use of this in
    my side project?
    -   I wonder how expensive it would get?
        -   Oh.
            -   Yeah. For some reason it didn't work on linux and looped and I spent 20bux.
        -   Spent some time debugging trying to use local llama3
            -   Breaks down at the last step though, didn't see any github issues,
                etc. - trying a couple more runs.
