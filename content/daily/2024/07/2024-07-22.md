#### [James Scott, RIP](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/james-scott-rip.html) {#james-scott-rip}

RIP. I still need to read his works. Screw it, seeing like a state in my next
nonfiction book (that's not tech related).

#### [Summer Wars]({{< relref "../../../main/movies.md#summer-wars" >}}) {#summer-wars--dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-main-movies-dot-md}

Couldn't sleep - watched this. Pretty good.

### Notes {#notes}

-   Okay, weekend's over. Focus on tech stuff + language.
-   Also signed up for Anthropic's pro plan. Claude (as of writing) is trouncing
    GPT. I expect it to shift again, but for now, I just pay for both. GPT4o-mini
    might make things interesting for RAG.
-   The [GraphRAG](<https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag>) example using 'A Christmas Carol' only cost 20 cents with mini.
    Pretty neat.
    -   The entity extraction is fascinating, you could.. theoretically populate an
        entire wiki/garden site like this using an LLM if you wanted.
        -   Wikis of content all written by people who don't exist[^1].
        -   I'd like to tinker with it more - [GraphRAG]({{< relref "../../../main/graphrag.md" >}})

[^1]: I exist, I think.
