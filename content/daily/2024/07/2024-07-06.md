## Notes {#notes}

-   "the typical adult in china knows approximately 8,000 to 10,000 hanzi"

-   I've been using SVP with mpv - I think this works well enough combined with shaders.

## Journal {#journal}

Weekend. Need to tinker with vapoursynth more. Got distracted and didn't get to
futz around with as much. Then to make progress on my thing I'm working on,
then Chinese studying. I've noticed ~300 cards tends to take about 2-3 hours.
