### Reading/Watching {#reading-watching}

-   Finally caught up on [The Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)) - this is more hate watching at this point.
    It's basically become "And then current thing happened, and everyone clapped"
    the tv show.
    -   The comic, while it has not aged well in political sensibilities, has a much
        more cohesive arc (some plot points, aside).

### Notes {#notes}

-   Downloaded kontroller(?) - for my moonlander, a rust CLI for controlling your
    keyboard programmatically.
    -   I guess I could change colors or something based on certain events, and the
        moonlander has space for spelling out words if I wanted.
        -   I can't really think of a usecase outside of amusement at the moment.
-   I try not to dunk on them, but every time I wander around on Mastodon I see at
    least one "AI is useless no normal person would need this!" take I'm reminded
    of the time I saw some random blue-collar-lookin-guy using one of those
    roleplay chatbot things at a park.
