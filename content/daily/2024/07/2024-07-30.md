### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Notes {#notes}

-   I still can't figure out the priority stuff
-   I need to fix the anchor links?
    -   Got these done - forked ox-hugo and will submit a PR maybe?
    -   I still need to figure out the whole references / footnotes thing
-   Really need to catch back up on Chinese.
-   Need to make more notes about random media I'm watching too - I realize it's a
    bit cringe but I feel like it can help cement the memory, even if it's
    something I never look at again.
    -   Realizing this after I noticed I couldn't recall the story to a manga I read
        not more than three months ago.
        -   The 'Flowers of Evil', btw.
-   Random thought: I do the 'all lower case' thing on SNS but I can't seem to do
    it in my notes - my brain refuses to let me forgo capitalization in certain contexts.
