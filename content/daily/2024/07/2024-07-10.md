## Journal {#journal}

Feel like this is going to be a "spend half the day catching up on Chinese"
kind of day.

I need to go back and fix the frontmatter for my previous days too
(For some reason, probably because of the rebuild step, it'd recreate the files
each time and thus count it as a new "create date" - need to brute force it by
adding a date to the file)
