#### Misc {#misc}

-   Ended up tinkering on site into the AM
    -   This, of course, borked me over in Chinese studies.
    -   I tried making a wrapper component but I think the way to how the DOM is
        interacted with, it didn't work out well
    -   So I just got annoyed and made a new component that imports the things I want
        -   If you see on the side, the dice (assuming it's still there and you're
            looking at this around the time of writing) will take you to a random
            page. I probably did this in a dumb way since it takes the allFiles. So
            might try to figure out an alternate way of doing it after I have more notes
