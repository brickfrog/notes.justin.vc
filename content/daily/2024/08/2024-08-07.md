#### [Netflix Open Sources Maestro, a Next-Gen Data Workflow Engine - The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/netflix-open-sources-maestro-a-next-gen-data-workflow-engine/) {#netflix-open-sources-maestro-a-next-gen-data-workflow-engine-the-new-stack}

This is probably indirectly sponsored, but still, kinda neat. I assume this is

#### [Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com) {#glamorous-toolkit}

Smalltalk (I guess technically Pharo)! - Kinda neat. Moldable development, might
need to tinker around with this when exploring a codebase. Smalltalk is still a
bit foreign to me, though. I was always not great at OOP.
