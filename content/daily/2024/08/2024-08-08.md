#### Umbrella Academy {#umbrella-academy}

I don't remember the previous seasons enough to have a lot of thoughts on this.
I remembered liking the first season, and enthralled enough to finish each
season quickly, but... I'm not sure. Pretty much any scene with Five was fun, at least.

### Notes {#notes}

-   Made some site edits. Still want to figure out the anchor weirdness.
-   The whole Ukraine situation kind of sidetracked my attention.
-   Okay, really need to get back on the 'studying Chinese' horse - throwing this
    out into the ether so I do a bit of it.
